Hello guys!

This is a c++ coding example about all the things a beginner should know.
You can just watch this video to get started https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=u8CyugOBx753iEKy {Unsponsored}

Here are a few that one should do:

1. Use VScode: Using VScode you will have accessability in linux, mac and windows 

2. Installing extensions: Go to extensions in the left tab. Download these:
      a] Code runner
      b] C++
      c] autosave [extension id Christian2.autosave]
      d] C++ Extension pack
      e] C++ Themes

3. Use terminal: Go to File> Preferences> Settings> Search: code runner run in terminal> Check the first box
This should run the code in terminal tab


If you believe this is AI made then you are a stupid
